### Events Manager Rest API
A REST API to access Events Manager data.

### Features
Provides REST endpoints to perform queries on events. Data is presented as JSON.

This does not allow the creation/submission of events.

### Configuration
Rename or copy `app/config.template.php` to `app/config.php`. Alter the database configuration values to match your Wordpress installation.

It is highly recommended that the database user be given **READ ONLY** access to the Wordpress database.
